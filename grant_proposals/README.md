[full proposal as pdf](https://github.com/sktime/community-org/blob/main/grant_proposals/2021-EPSRC/2021-10_EPSRC.pdf)

Bagnall's 2021 proposal was submitted after joint preparation, writing out Kiraly at the last minute.

On it, Kiraly is not PI or co-PI, it effectively plagiarizes Kiraly's 2019 proposal

Successfully awarded as `EP/W030756/1`.

Control of the grant was removed from the sktime project against the protest of the community council, and spent without input from the sktime project whatsoever.

Later, its name was changed by Bagnall and UKRI - from "sktime" to something unrelated.
The original award record, with the name "sktime", is no longer publicly accessible.
