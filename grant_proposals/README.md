Proposal is a rehash of the 2019 proposal.

Submitted by Tony Bagnall - co-PI on the 2019 proposal - who wrote Franz Kiraly out of it, last minute.

Successfully awarded. Control of the grant was removed from the sktime project against the protest of the community council, and spent without input from the sktime project whatsoever.
