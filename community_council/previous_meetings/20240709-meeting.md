    * FK: Submitted application to python software foundation (PSF), which has been recieved and some questions asked from them. Currently beeing considered for 5000$ for travel and lodging for mentees and attendees. Defined as open to apply, similar to previous years. Expectation from PSF on us to run a fair application process.
        * MR: timelines? FK: ~couple of weeks, but good that already had quick response with questions

4. Elections timelines, comms
    * FK: first post drafted and up for internal review. Timelines suggested in post. Time to raise awareness & ensure that mentees have finished so they have time to decide adn get engages without feeling pressured. Opening after mentoring period (last mentee finishes Aug 21st), but announcing before. Potentially can add voter registration earlier. Potential options:
        * Option 1:
            * from now: comms starts
            * Sep 8 - candidate registration open
            * Sep 22 - candidate registration deadline
            * **voter registration same as candidate registration**
            * until Oct 1 - candidate statements
            * Oct 1 - 7 election period
            * results announced Oct 10
        * Option 2:
            * **open voter registration already now**
            * voter registration deadline Sep 22
            * rest same
        * Option 3 etc
            * sth else
            * e.g., move to Sep 1?
                * too close to dev days, logistic overload?
    * UO: do we have voter registration tech in place?
        * FK: similar form (user registration), can be used as template
        * action FK: voter registration form
    * MR: suggests option 2 as a way for menteed to commit to voting while still working on their project and motivated
    * Action on all: timebox to end of this week for review Friday 12
