8. governance working group
    * FK - update
        * discussion thread with wikimedia now concluding
        * FK opinion: gov model, voting should be next topic to consolidate after vision statement
        * FK: prepared user registration (incl voter registration) to send out, to share internally before send out, appreciate feedback (1wk)
            * action
    * vision statement - now for decision (from May 20, until May 27)
        * formally still some hours left to discuss or suggest changes
    * problem/challenge: voting technology
        * someone should look into this
            * internal and external
            * JB action to look into easypoll
            * any other suggestions appreciated
            * wikipedia is non-replicable (?), they have custom solution "securepoll"
                * JS - maybe it is replicable!
                * action JS - investigabe replicablility of securepoll to sktime: internal voting and decision making (anon), polling, elections (council internal and board with external contributor voters)
        * slack anon voting no longer free (100 votes limit)
            * KR: jonathan proposed discord voting plugin
                * FK - same as easypoll

9. FK - benchmarking/prophet next steps

* there has been discussion on GitHub issue
* opinion: we should try to move this
    * design? working group?
    * FYI or asking for suggestions how to progress
        * anyone who would like to drive workstream?
        * fallback FK drives
    * JS: not sure what this is
    * FK summary
        * prophet reached out that it would be great host benchmark results on sktime
        * JB, FK had discussion - positive, and ended in decision to collaborate
        * together opened issue to discuss: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/4543
        * three streams so far that should be brought "together"
            * sktime old benchmark framework (suffers from overdesign)
            * sktime new framework based on kotsu, driven by authors of kotsu (Daniel Cerigo et a)
            * pycaret based benchmarking (complete benchmark but does not talk directly to estimator interface)
        * need for design, need for coordination
        * option to volunteer, coordinate
    * FK suggestion: leave here for someone to pick up and drive, fallback is FK drives

10. FK - technical roadmap

* usually: sync meeting either in dev days (start) or onboarding days
    * FK can run technical roadmap planning
    * also would be sth that would benefit from involvement of developers (e.g., Anirban, Benedikt, Sagar)
    * current approach: schedule as part of dev days or onboarding days, someone runs the 1h-2h workshop to extract roadmap priorities
        * problem: mostly developer focused
        * how do we get user input?
        * could use user registration form
        * could invite users to event
        * KR: maybe townhall with advane advertising?
            * discuss in Mon events meeting
            * Ugo: will try to come up with some ideas (linkedin, events)
    * FK - default approach currently: onboarding days = copy-paste from last year; part of dev days
        * maybe we can do better? ideas appreciated
