## Agenda

1. FK: de-escalation of current situation

we need to deescalate this *jointly*

suggest agenda point: start by explaining concerns about current situation (MW, GB concerns?)

try to focus on own perception, non-violent/non-accusatory

then discuss immediate actions

if not agreed: would agree to mediation?



## Notes


## Appendix: FK concerns for de-escalation discussion

(comment: these notes are here in public due to discussion already happening on public channels, e.g., sktime PR and issue tracker)

FK main concerns:

a. escalating CoC violations and near misses in the community - immediate concern!
we both need to work addressing this. CoC cannot be casualty of politics.
Other core devs already report substantial effects on personal well-being.
Fear of stepping up to avoid becoming a target. This must end now.

b. attempted change of governance rules not consensus based, and during ongoing CoC violations.
-> can we move to consensus based process? otherwise danger of forking sktime community
-> need to together end ongoing CoC violations before we have any discussion on governance

c. "good governance" means accountability, checks & balances, incl CoC, but also financial and decision making accountability. Ad-hoc changes to governance do more harm than benefit there in FK opinion. Good governance model needs to be designed in a longer process, feedback and criticism needs to have space.

d. fears that vision of sktime as charitable enterprise is in danger - no longer a focus on providing opportunities and education world-wide. MW suggested changes in governance model will concentrate power to people with history of not contributing to this vision (how many events run? new contributors mentored? helpdesk activities? etc), and overall to a less diverse crowd.

e. "giving up power" is *not* a primary concern!

But can't do that if it means giving up on the CoC or accountability/transparency practices. This would mean failing in duty as CoC committee chair and community co-leader.

FK fears: "removal of FK agenda" both an aim and a means to an end here, i.e., de-facto disempowering CoC and accountability mechanisms.
In the new governance model proposed by MW: Who will arbitrate if CC or core devs misbehave? Will trolling, dogpiling as currently happening be ok? Soft embezzelement of funds? Bullying, harassment?

already now, "neutral" core devs and externals do not want to step up, do not want to get involved in this.

Need to get back to a state where difficult content discussions can be had without fear and hurt.
