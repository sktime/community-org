## Agenda

1. NumFOCUS - Leah Silen, Arliss Collins
   
   discussion points:
   * any points from NumFOCUS
   * questions from sktime community on contracts
       * MW: clause 10 comprehensive - governance model. Does this has to agree 100%
           * e.g., CC appointment is by 2/3 majority of core devs and simple majority of CC
           * Leah: more conditions are ok, contract is "minimum", e.g., single dictator is not ok
       * FK: difference between comprehensive and grantor/grantee model
           * Leah: main difference is in the context of an existing project with EIN
           * if project funds are already present in the project, grantor/grantee caters for that situation
           * comprehensive brings incoming funds under numfocus tax EIN
           * no difference in legal protection, trademark handling
           * grantor/grantee to comprehensive is easy move
       * question from numfocus - what support needed
           * handling income, expendutire
           * assets - trademarks, assets
           * contracting
       * FK: fundraising restriction clause (cl 10) in grantor/grantee model
           * Leah: requirement is that numfocus is involved in the process and counterparts are aware of numfocus, fundraising is encouraged in general
       * MW: clause 9 comprehensive, can you please explain?
           * implies: check that spent on project benefit, not personal benefit or third party benefit unrelated to project, in line with non-profit status
           * implies: check for formal approval by leadership entity (here: community council)
       * from Lovkush: meaning of "charitable purpose"
           * Leah: science and education for the public benefit
           * in line with 501(c)(3) science/education
       * MW: conditions on successor option, clause 15 of comprehensive, what happens for non-US charity? Contract is specifically US
           * Leah: from internal discussion, comparable entity abroad should be fine
           * from contract, must be US tax exempt, but it should be possible to move to EU
           * action Leah: clarify, perhaps broaden claus (EU option)
       * next steps
