## Notes

1. Introductions

2. open discussion

community member 1 (industry DS):

- relying on `sktime` in production
- what is going on? what will happen?

  * FK: `sktime` original branch is operating,
  * FK: none of release managers, architects have left; dev/maintain capacity not reduced
  * FK: "fork" is mainly Tony Bagnall's direct network at UEA (University of East Anglia)
  * FK: fork makes a lot of noise, includes "shocker" events every few weeks to generate visibility

- followed hijack of documentation/readthedocs

  * FK: yes, took some time until readthedocs restored access, project got destroyed and blocked the name space
  * FK: key assets under `sktime` control, except pypi - worst case is change in pypi name (not conda name)

- clear that this is an attempt at hijacking project and the brand
- already the `numba` and governance business in Nov/Dec by fork group was toxic

  * FK: damage to `sktime` brand and attacking trust of users may be part of strategy

- "deprecation" business by mloning is unprofessional
- disingenuous, it's not "deprecation" but removal, destruction
- mloning says "he will make a decision" but does not say how will take user or community input in
- none of the users want "deprecation" of `sktime`, see the discussion thread on mloning's repo
- most of users probably will be caught unawares, are not on discord
- but mloning's actions also fall back on `sktime` and NumFOCUS, have failed to keep assets safe
- users rely on `sktime`, in production systems
- primarily need to ensure stability towards users! whatever fork does
- who knows what mloning does next

  * FK: probably need to announce change to temporary home on pypi, e.g., `sktime-backup`

- good idea, mloning situation can be resolved in parallel, may take longer
- need to pre-empt scenario where mloning uploads garbage or does sth similar to what happened to readthedocs
- would be good to send out an announcement on "next steps" soon

- governance: users should have more say
- Cannot be that developers do sth like this and there's no checks.

  * FK: sth we're considering, see issue 4234

- suggest to look for examples how other projects manage this

  * FK: a community member on Apr 21 suggested the same
  * FK: looked into this - we originally took template from sklearn and OS carpentry
  * FK: it seems there is a problem with projects that are successful but not super successful
  * FK: late stage projects are incorporated as charities or at companies; sktime is not incorporated
  * FK: almost got incorporated with NumFOCUS, but conflict erupted just days before the deadline
  * FK: explains bit of background on UKRI grant and disagreements, context of resource allocation

- governance: too many votes for people from UEA? becauase one vote per person
- can introduce the rule that at most one vote per organisation, weighted down

  * FK: were thinking of similar idea; some OS org have that rule (e.g., at most one committee member from an org, or weighting)
  * FK: what about contracting relationships, customer/vendor relations, etc?
  * cm2: in Germany, there are laws that treat these certain indirect arrangements direct membership, could do sth similar
  * better have an imperfect version of the rule than no such rule at all

- governance: is money the problem? What if sktime did not accept money anymore

  * FK: some money is needed to pay for internship, run dev events, e.g., one summer internship ca 5k
  * FK: thinks problem is not with money overall, but more with how UKRI and funding bodies disburse
  * FK: assumes university as target location, so forces reliance on senior academics
  * FK: no checks on the "PI-s", e.g., no external audit, no functioning arbitration, facilitates corruption
  * FK: sktime had open collective, open administration of funds - but grant cannot be paid that way!
  * FK: first thing that sktime grant holder refused was to publish a budget on expenditures
  * FK: if incorporated, e.g, NumFOCUS, can receive and administrate grant moneys - but that got prevented

- is there something I can do to help?

  * FK: yes!
  * code contributions
  * donations (internships, maintenance)
  * participation in sprints, event org
  * mentoring
  * helping with admin


community member 2 (industry DS)

- relying on `sktime` for consultancy and presentations
- renaming `sktime` is silly, no need for this
- if you fork, you don't try to destroy the original project
- especially valid point about tutorials, and material created by third people, this will stop working
- deployment pipelines will break
- upset about ad-hominem attacks in mloning's discussion thread by people who favour "deprecation"
- this entire thing is bizarre
- who is mloning? why does he have pypi acct?

  * FK: gives some background
  * FK: mloning created the acct 5 years ago
  * FK: left & became inactive 2021, ignored later requests to hand pypi acct over to sktime council

(then mostly listens to conversation between cm1 and FK)


FK summary of the above:

- opening up of governance positively received
- idea (already in Feb 21 meet): investigate prior art on governance models
- idea: votes for user group representatives or committee
- idea: mechanism, only one vote per organisation, no matter how many community members, prevents committee packing
- suggestion: move pypi name, even if only temporarily, to give users a secure location to install from
