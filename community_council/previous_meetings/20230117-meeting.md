## Agenda

1. purpose of this meeting: operations of `sktime` in 1st half of 2023, e.g.:
  * volunteering for roles - mentoring programme, GSoC 2023 application, new contributor onboarding, event org
  * high-level interest in tech roadmap topics, workstreams; workstream org
  * Friday schedule (or other day)

Meeting is for volunteers running `sktime`, for our contributors and users. Need consensus: no gov topics today.

2. Orgs topics to discuss today? Suggested order is decreasing time sensitivity
  * mentoring, GSoC applications
  * staffing helpdesk, community collab sessions, weekly community stand-up/meet&greet
  * tech workstreams
  * Friday schedule starting Jan 20 (conditional on tech workstreams)
  * developer events - mentee/mentor onboarding, dev days
  * presence at conferences, submissions

3. mentoring, GSoC
  * currently 5 mentees and further applicants, need mentors & co-mentors
  * GSoC appl opens Jan 23, closes Feb 7 - need mentors (names), project topics (see [2022 project topic ideas](https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/internships/projects_2022.md) )
  * potential other internship programmes; internships from UKRI grant (UK taxpayer)

4. helpdesk, community collab sessions, meet&greet
  * collab sessions
    * usually on Fridays - one or more experienced dev present, helps with screenshare, env setup, using sktime
    * weekly stand-up/meet&greet usually on Fridays - was at start of collab sessions
    * best time - clear now or set up poll?
  * helpdesk on discord
    * should be watched daily, most questions can be answered by ref to docs or help filling out bug report
    * any volunteers? volunteer can pick one day a week or one day a month

4. tech workstreams
  * some existing projects and new community interest
    * current projects: annotation, pipelines, deep learning
    * lost attendance - interest still there but need time & someone to "pace" meetings, run kanban boards (if applicable)
    * new topics? sktime scaling - dask, distributed; benchmark module; new learning tasks
  * volunteers?

5. Friday schedule (or other day), based on above?

6. developer events 1st half 2023
  * onboarding mentees for winter session - giving intro presentation. Should be soon if we do this! (early Feb?)
  * onboarding days for summer - assuming GSoC or other programme participation, mid May
  * developer days - best around or after Mar/Apr conferences (can announce them there)

7. presence at conferences
  * short talks; workshops; sprints
  * early Feb: submission date for pydata 2023 US

interest?
requirement = good coding experience, some mentoring experience (e.g., academic or industry professional)
commitment = 2-3 hours a week, reachable every 2 days (mentor), or meeting once a week & occasional PR reviews (co-mentor)
co-mentor = work alongside a full mentor, get experienced with mentoring programme (GSoC or sktime etc)

(none present feel experienced?)
ping FK or one of the sktime devs if interested


4. helpdesk, community collab sessions, meet&greet
  * collab sessions
    * usually on Fridays - one or more experienced dev present, helps with screenshare, env setup, using sktime

previously: Fri 1pm or 2pm UTC
tends to work well acorrs time zones

Jonathan: 1pm is 4am west coast - not very compatible

4pm UTC? -> 9:30pm


current schedule - two meetings
7:30am UTC, 1pm UTC

thoughts about best time/day

:+1:

poll - who would show up at the slot
regularly = at least once every 2 weeks
if it were happening at

7:30am UTC :+1::+1:

1pm UTC :+1::+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1:

4pm UTC :+1::+1: :+1::+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1:

-> let's do it at 4pm then (4-5pm with greet & standup at the start)


volunteering for "watching the help desk" - commitment = pick a day or so, *be welcoming* and helpful (mentoring by an sktime dev possible)

-> would be much appreciated, it is encouraged to help other members of the community with their questions (e.g., "where is this doc", ...) - be welcoming, polite, helpful!


4. tech workstreams
  * some existing projects and new community interest
    * current projects: annotation, pipelines, deep learning
    * lost attendance - interest still there but need time & someone to "pace" meetings, run kanban boards (if applicable)
    * new topics? sktime scaling - dask, distributed; benchmark module; new learning tasks
  * volunteers?


## :clipboard: Areas of interest - high-level topics

**(1) :point_right: identify high-level topics, areas, goals, that you feel are important to work on over the summer. Type them out below, kindly be careful to not overwrite input by others.**
(5-10 min)

inspiration: sktime 2022 summer project ideas
https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/internships/projects_2022.md


Understanding the entire codebase and Working on sktime scaling and new learning tasks.Also, trying to build good documents and publishing blogs of my technical journey. Suggesting new project ideas which would be trendy and useful.Engaging with the community members and learn from them. - Aarthy R

Implementing newer time series annotation techniques into sktime, like github issue for ESPRESSO - JonathanB 
Taking on general coding issues to become more familiar with codebase, better ML Engineer / Data Scientist - JonathanB (+1 Margaret) 
Building interfaces that allow you to use sktime with newest time series DL models -- NBeats, TFTTransformer, etc - JonathanB 

Related to above, implementing bandpass filters for economic/econometric data (e.g. BK filter, Christiano Fitzgerald) in Sktime - Margaret 

Looking to merge financial applications/models with sktime forecasting - Kev (Linxin) 

At a high-level, I think advances in unsupervised learning in time series is very interesting, since regime change is
such an important issue for time based data. - JonathanB


[wrap-up: "clustering" or "merging" of similar topics, move to (2) below]

**(2) :point_right: you have three :+1: that you can distribute to the topics, means "I think this is important". One topic can get multiple :+1:.
Also, distribute :heavy_check_mark: which means "I will (or want to) work on this over the next months".**
(5-10min)


**forecasting ("modern" & specialized models)** - existing WS
:heavy_check_mark:
* forecasting/DL interface

**improving collaborative coding practice, working with community** - regular events (e.g., *running* weekly stand-ups, participating in intro/onboarding type events, sprints, etc)

FK interpretation
* primary interest is getting better at collaborative coding, understanding code base and "getting some algos implemented"
* workstream topic mostly - annotation, transformers/filters, regime switching models (intersection anotation, trafos, simulators)
-> start with one workstream meeting
4:15 pm UTC (1/2 hour into collab session)

Jan 20 meeting for "roadmapping", longer meeting (1 hour?)

forecasting, DL -> there is existing workstream, meetings might start at later time (Jan 27) -> Danbartl, Sagar Mishra


5. Friday schedule (or other day), based on above?

see above


at 75 min, revisit other topics when more developers are present
