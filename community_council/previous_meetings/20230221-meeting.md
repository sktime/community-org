## Agenda

Q/A session on governance of sktime going forward
https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/4234

Actively asking for input from community

* participation and input of users, packages depending on sktime, junior career community members (potential mentees)
* decision making structures, conflict resolution

1. Introduction by FK
2. open discussion
   * community Q/A
   * discussion topics of interest (tbd)


## Notes

1. Introduction by FK
    * want to move towards more democratic governance - involving users, potential mentees/interns etc
    * think need to represent more user groups; potential mentees and new contributors
    * big question: how to design mechanisms? what do community members find important?


2. open discussion

community member 1 (industry DS):

- democratic good idea
- also things there should be some "earning the right to vote or be elected"
- but it might be hard to think of fair mechanism
- part of the problem - someone can go away and create fork?
    - FK: that´s actually benefit of open source
    - community member 1: enemy of continuity though, bad for users!

decision making

- finds there should be ultimate point of decision, avoiding deadlock, like in business
- FK: how works in business, startup?
    - community member 1: there are few and also last decision makers, e.g., CEO - conflict resolution by hierarchy
    - code also has final decision makers
    - that person can be elected - middle ground
    - but it´s dangerous, since that is also a position that people will want, mixes tech decision making and politics
- open & streamlined decision making, could be charity model, charity has CEO, board, etc
    - FK: common UK charity models have regular elections, max terms

community member 2 (industry DS)

- important that there are enough people to be representative gruops
- continuity and reliability is important and in the interest of users, this is crucial!
- mentoring is also important, sourcing mentors seems like a challenge
- mechanism design is a challenge
- feels stability is about process, and how agreement is managed
- investigate how other open source projects are organizing governance
    - FK: good idea. Collating prior art, maybe asking experts
    - FK: tried this before, tough getting to know "how things work on the inside"
    - FK: many projects have code of conduct, gov documents that deal with communication and moderation primarily
    - FK: thinks what is also important is resource allocation issues
        - some project that have funding to govern, like astropy, have rules there
 - how did sktime start?
    - FK: sktime originally building on tempalte of sklearn
    - (also asked numfocus for input on governance design but no input)
    - FK: many actual governance models when drilling down are "tribal with a halo", e.g., one or few well-aligned research groups; a group of contributors

community members 3 and 4 (junior career, students)

- happy for opportunities via internship, mentorship programme
- feels goal of participation is the right direction
- not sure how - not very experienced in governance or committee work
- wouldn't feel confident sitting on committees since early career

community members 5, 6 (1 industry, 1 anon on discord)

- just here to listen


FK summary of the above:

Community group - end user

- for end users, stability and reliability is very important
   - interested to promote stable governance, making package reliable
- interested in being involved in decision making
- concerned about, and interested to prevent friction in governance model and leaders

Community group - junior career

- opportunities for upskilling, mentoring very important
   - especially if from underrepresented or underprivilieged background
- low experience in governance since early career
- not much time to invest in participative governance
- will be challenge how to represent this interest group fairly
   - could be election model, if not requires time investment

Overall

- opening up of governance positively received
- mechanism design not obvious
- idea: charitable incorporation
- idea: investigate prior art on governance models
