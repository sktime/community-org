## Notes


## Appendix - KNIME (from Patrick)

from Patrick: Potential Cooperation with KNIME (https://www.knime.com)
* KNIME is a software to create and productionize data science using one easy and intuitive environment
* KNIME is currently working on python M/L functionality 
* We might cooperate with KNIME on integrating sktime their software by adapters
* Advatanges: increase visibility of sktime - integrate into an easy to use GUI with a large (commercial) customer base, might be part of some hackathon? Other options (thought og pydata initially)?
* Disadvantages: KNIME is partially commercial, but distribtues its software open source (GNU)
