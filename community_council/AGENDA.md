5. procedure standing agreement - decision making incl async input. For transition period, final modus part of gove design.
   * standard decision items? FK proposal: 5 working day rule ("async log in once a week") for input and votes, table in weekly meeting. Attendance not necessary, but description of what decision is.

6. arising from 2023-03-17 - expenditure for Sagar to attend pydata Seattle
   * text of original proposal.
       * workshop accepted on skbase. FK, Ryan and tentatively Sagar Mishra (contributors to base) will travel
       * Sagar Mishra (achieveordie) needs travel funding
           * reason: contributed persistence and other base features
           * would be great to support early career contributor (important networking opportunity, presentation opportunity)
       * usually we would apply to NumFOCUS or use research grant funds, but that's not an option (due to the splinter group controlling some money and NumFOCUS no longer affiliated)
       * FK suggestion for expense - reimbursement via sktime open collective, max total of 2.500 GBP
       * FK will donate at least twice the amount to sktime from personal funds (irrespective of decision taken here)
       * usual procedure (decided to adopt for now): proposed in first council meeting (above), decision in second council meeting and async round until then; comes into effect when minutes of decision are confirmed in 3rd meeting, all meetings at least 1 calendar week apart
       * please note conflict of interest - Sagar Mishra is a member of this council (as per point 4) and must recuse himself
   * decision procedure subject to agreement in 4
