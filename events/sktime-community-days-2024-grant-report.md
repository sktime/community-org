## Transparency statement on spending of the PSF grant for sktime community days

This document details spending and beneficiaries of the PSF grant for community day attendance.

### 2024 community days

The grant was used in supporting the [2024 community days](https://github.com/sktime/community-org/blob/main/events/sktime-community-days-2024.md#travel-grants-for-sktime-community-days-2024),
with the original intention to fund a larger amount of attendees. Unfortunately, timelines were too short for visa applications, so people could not travel and most committed funds were not spent.

Beneficiaries of the grant are below, in alphabetical order of last name.

Columns are:

* last name of applicant
* first name of applicant
* total sum requested
* total sum committed, sums are plus contingent coverage
* total disbursed
* whether the commitment was withdrawn, and if yes by which side

| Vieira      | Felipe Angelim     | 1,800     | 800       |                       830      | no        |

Note: total sum of commitments exceeds the grant sum, as commitments were made after higher listed applicants withdrew due to visa timelines.
